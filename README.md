# Fractals

A 3-days project made in collaboration between Nathan F., Corentin G. and Marin S. under supervision of Evelyne L in the INT21 class of ENSTA Paris.

**The goal is to generate new sets of fractals, from a set of 4 original fractals, by giving each fractal a mark between 0 and 9.**

Fractals are merged using evolutionary algorithms and by taking into account each fractals grade given by the user.

To test this project, just run graphics.py.
